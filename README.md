# IEEE-ATtiny-programming-workshop

This project was created for a Penn State Harrisburg IEEE student chapter workshop.

The code was taken from the following repo: https://github.com/lonesoulsurfer/Tiny_Arcade_Games
The code was modified to work with the PCB I created following a schematic provided by Terry Tirko.

The code is intended to work with a platformio project and uploaded through the included AVR toolchain.
